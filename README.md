# Python-Project
The assignment consists in creating a software that computes an algorithm to convert a positive integer or float into its equivalent 
representation in a different base “b” (with “b” any of 2,3,4,5, ….,10).
The Software asks for the user input for the number to convert and the base, it converts user’s number into user’s base of choice. 
It also checks for infinite binary expansions and stops after printing 20 digits.
